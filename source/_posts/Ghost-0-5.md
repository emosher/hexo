A week ago Ghost 0.5 was released and this blog is now upgraded to 0.5.

Thanks to the Ghost [documentation](http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-5/) and [How to Install Ghost](http://www.howtoinstallghost.com/how-to-update-ghost/), the upgrade process was a breeze.

### Features

See the Ghost [blog](http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-5/) for the full list of features.

Ghost 0.5 brings a whole host of new features. A newly refactored admin interface, public JSON API, and multiple user support.

### New Release Schedule

These new features are great, but what I am most excited about is the new release schedule. Instead of releasing 2-3 times a year in large milestones, they are moving to a more continuous release schedule. From the above post by [Hannah Wolfe](http://hannah.wf/): 

> Starting today, we're moving to a more agile release process. Every 2-4 weeks we're going to ship new features, improvements and bug-fixes to Ghost. There won't be any more big-bang events like this one. There will be smaller, more frequent announcements that we've released new features, fixes and improvements.

What appeals to me most about this is that I can choose to upgrade when they release a feature that I really want. Instead of waiting months for a single feature, I can look for the specific timeframe they intend on delivering that feature.

I hope this new schedule works out for them and I'm happy to see them make this change!
