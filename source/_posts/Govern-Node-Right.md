I'm going to take a minute to comment on the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) fork known as [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html). 

**tl;dr** - Node.js and io.js should merge and the Node Foundation should use the [open governance model](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md) proven by io.js

### The Fork

When io.js started I was mostly apathetic about the fork. I thought it *could* lead to good things but it was too soon to tell. To quote Eran Hammer's [post on the subject](http://hueniverse.com/2014/12/04/before-the-drama/): "Can things get better? Absolutely!"

That was largely my sentiment before the first of the year. As time passed, I started to see how io's governance model gave me a great deal of insight into where they were going and what they wanted to do.

### Investment

I'm not a contributor to the Node.js core, but I am a heavy user of it. I use it when writing frontend JavaScript with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). I've built APIs with [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Hapi](http://hapijs.com/). Recently I started exploring static site generators like [Hexo](http://hexo.io/). Not to mention this blog runs on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) which is of course built on Node. **To say that I am heavily invested in Node would be accurate.**

The existence of the fork makes for plenty of confusion as to what works and what doesn't. I've probably [felt the pain](http://www.williamjohnbert.com/2015/02/why-id-like-node-and-io-dot-js-to-merge/) less than others.

### Governance and the Way Forward

So where do Node.js and io.js go from here?

Joyent [recently announced](https://www.joyent.com/about/press/joyent-moves-to-establish-nodejs-foundation) the creation of the Node.js Foundation. This is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done. The two projects need to merge.

#### Open Governance

In the 2 years or so I've used Node I don't think I've ever had as clear of an idea of where the project was going as in the short time that io.js has been around. This is why I firmly believe that the Node.js foundation should adopt the [io.js governance model](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md).

A recent io.js [blog post](https://medium.com/@iojs/io-js-and-a-node-js-foundation-4e14699fb7be) hinted that this is a possibility. I hope that the techical committee makes this a reality.

#### A Word of Thanks

I was inspired to write this by William Bert's site [nodegovernance.io](http://nodegovernance.io/) and [his post](http://www.williamjohnbert.com/2015/02/why-id-like-node-and-io-dot-js-to-merge/) on the subject. A big thank you to him and the rest of the Node.js/io.js community.
