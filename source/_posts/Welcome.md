Welcome to my blog. Here you will find the ranting and raving of a Software Engineer, musician, techie, open source fan/advocate and gamer. 

### First Things First

I'll be posting here about any and all things related to technology, music, and world events. While I may mention world events and/or the politics surrounding them, I tend to stay away from purely political discussions. Sure, I have opinions but I'll leave the politicking to the politicians.

I created this blog because there are a lot of things I like to talk about and this seems like a good way to do that. I welcome discussion and/or criticism.

### Links

You can find me on social media, and other places on the interwebs at the links below.

### This Blog is...

#### Published with Ghost

This blog is published with [Ghost](https://ghost.org). Ghost is a blogging platform built on Node.js. It is open source and hosted on Github. I hope you like it, because I sure do.

Maybe one day I'll get around to contributing to Ghost - until then, using it will have to suffice.  :-) 

#### Hosted in the Cloud

This blog is hosted in the cloud with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). And yes, I tried other platforms, investigated prices, etc. This was the easiest and cheapest I could find. I'm open to suggestions, but [Digital's Ocean's one click deploy of Ghost](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application) was hard to beat.

#### A Work in Progress

I hope to be making a lot of changes to the blog over time. Right now, I'm using the default theme called [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper). I'm going to get around to changing this eventually. Many of themes out there have the ability to use [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) comments (or Facebook or Google+ or ...). I'd like to add this option here, but I probably won't get to it right away.
