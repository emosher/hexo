I recently had a conversation that involved the need for a basic knowledge of code, Computer Science, and Technology in the educational system of the United States.

This led me to once again, look up [Code.org](http://code.org/). 

If you are unfamiliar with Code.org, the basic idea is that all students should have the opportunity to code. Here's a little rant on why code needs to be part of every educational system.

#### 1. The future of the economy depends on technology

Hopefully this point is self explanatory. Look at the direction of every sector of the economy in the past couple decades. Just think of all the technology around you every day. Nearly all business is done with some kind of computer. Not to mention the plethora of mobile devices you find everywhere today. Hopefully this is self explanatory - technology is everywhere. The future depends on understanding it and being able to smartly use it.
