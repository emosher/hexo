A while back, I had the **distinct** pleasure of presenting a talk about HTML5. It was an interesting ride trying to get up to speed on some of the historical context as to why HTML5 is important.

### New Kid on the Block

When I started working on web applications, the HTML5 drafts had already been around a while and the last call for the 5.0 spec had [already been made](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5).

Around early to mid 2012 is when I really started diving into learning to build web based applications. I had the good fortune of working in a very forward thinking development shop. I was even told to focus more on the HTML5 side of things and not on the older specs/browsers. 

I'm glad this worked out this way. I was able to learn how things *should* work. It was then a matter of learning how to make things work in older browsers on an ad hoc basis - rather than having to learn all of that at once.

### Learning the Reasons *Why*

I was fortunate to have a good deal of help preparing for the talk. I could speak to the HTML5 features pretty well because of my time learning and using HTML5. The experience was enlightening when it came to the history of the web.

#### The Web - A Very Rich History



### web generations
One of the things I used in my talk was the phrases Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0. These tend to be buzz words more than anything but they can basically be summed up as follows.

#### Web 1.0

The first generation of the web comprised largely of static html. CGI Scripts were used during this time to help make pages dynamic.
